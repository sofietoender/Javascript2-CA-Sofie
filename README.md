# Social Media Front-End Client

## Overview

The goal was to create an attractive, responsive user interface that allows users to view, post, edit, and delete social media content.

## Technologies Used

- **Tailwind CSS**: For styling the application. A CDN was used for Tailwind CSS in this project to quickly experiment with its features and focus on JavaScript. While CDNs are not recommended for production environments, this approach was chosen for initial development and testing.
- **JavaScript**

## Future Improvements

- **Production-ready Tailwind CSS**: Replace CDN with a build tool setup for production use.

- **Improve code organization for future projects**:
  For my future projects, I will make smaller modules and split the code better. I am now more familiar with these ideas, so it will be easier to use them in my next projects.
